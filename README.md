# Fill-a-Pix
This project implements multiple algorithms and heuristics to solve [Fill-a-Pix puzzles](http://www.conceptispuzzles.com/index.aspx?uri=puzzle/fill-a-pix) done in the context of the artificial intelligence course at [IST](http://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/). The project included a theoretical analysis of the algorithms and heuristics through which was determined the best algorithm and heuristic.

<h3> Search Algorithms </h3>

The search algorithms were generated by combining a backtracking search with different heuristics and inference algorithms.

The implemented inference algorithms are:
  - Forward checking
  - Maintaining Arc Consistency (MAC)
  
The implemented heuristics are:
  - Degree heuristic
  - Minimum Remaining Values heuristic (MRV)
  - Least Constraining Value heuristic (LCV)
  - MRV with degree heuristic to disambiguate equal values
