# Fill-a-Pix
This project was done in the context of the artificial intelligence course at [IST](http://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) and consists in an implementation of multiple algorithms and heuristics to solve [Fill-a-Pix puzzles](http://www.conceptispuzzles.com/index.aspx?uri=puzzle/fill-a-pix). Each Fill-a-Pix puzzle is represented as a [Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem). The project included a theoretical analysis of the algorithms and heuristics through which was determined the best combination of algorithm and heuristics.

<h3> Search Algorithms </h3>

The search algorithms were generated by combining a backtracking search with different heuristics and inference algorithms.

The implemented inference algorithms are:
  - Forward checking
  - Maintaining Arc Consistency (MAC)
  
The implemented heuristics are:
  - Degree heuristic
  - Minimum Remaining Values heuristic (MRV)
  - Least Constraining Value heuristic (LCV)
  - MRV with degree heuristic to disambiguate equal values
  
<h3> Data Structures </h3>

Two data structures were defined:
  - CSP structure - represents a puzzle and contains variables, constraints and domains
  - Constraint structure - represents a constraint and contains variables, values and a predicate

In Fill-a-Pix puzzles a constraint is a numbered square.
